# Project for CT60A2411 Object-Oriented Programming (April 2024)

This is the implementation of the project application by Radu Stoiana and Iikka Harjam√§ki. The Github repository is public and the API key for the OpenWeather API is in the files so there is no need to replace it; it will be redacted after project evaluation is completed.

The app should not require the installation or creation of any other resources. For any errors please reach out via email to: Radu.Stoiana@student.lut.fi

**The app targets API version 34!**

The rest of the documentation regarding the project is in the PDF file in this repository. 

### Thank you!
